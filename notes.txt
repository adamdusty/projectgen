todo:
    - Decide on template serialization format (json/yaml)
        - YAML
            - Easy to make, easy read
            - Needs third party lib (already using for viper/cobra)
            - Need to handle languages that use '#' for comments
            - Multiline literal string blocks make for nicer manual template creation
        - JSON
            - Easy to serialize/deserialize
            - Std lib/no dependency
            - Difficult to write for humans
            - Don't need special handling for language comments

    generate cmd:
        - [pgen . --template base/cpp-exe]
            - Find specified template in template directory
            - Search through template directory for file base/cpp-exe ($HOME/.pgen/templates/base/cpp-exe)
            - Load template from serialization format
            - Generate project at path given as first argument

            - Not sure if there is a way to eliminate the required template flag. Possibly give a shorthand.
        
    - Read available templates in template directory if given.
    - Give user optional set up on first time use.
    - Currently all errors are panic. Need to go back and implement appropriate error handling for each case.
